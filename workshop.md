# Workshop

I don't have any workshops scheduled shortly. [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iavins/) for updates. [Drop me an email](http://scr.im/avii) if you wish to arrange a workshop for your team/company.

A typical workshop session is 4 hours and can span over two days. It is a hands-on session where I will live code with you. Though I will code in Python, you / your team may pick any programming language you are comfortable with. We will also pair/mob program together.
